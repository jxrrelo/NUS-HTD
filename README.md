# NUS-HTD

NUS HTD is a temperature declaration system used by NUS. The purpose of the system was to ensure that all students declare their temperature twice a day.
This script was written only for educational purposes, experimentation, and convenience to those who wish to declare their temperature
in a faster way via the command line interface. Under no circumstances should this be abused.
