# NUS-HTD

NUS HTD is a temperature declaration system used by NUS. The purpose of the system was to ensure that all students declare their temperature twice a day.
This script was written only for educational purposes, experimentation, and convenience to those who wish to declare their temperature
in a faster way via the command line interface. Under no circumstances should this be abused.

# Usage

```python
nus_htd = NUSHTD("nusstu\\<NUSNET_ID>", "<PASSWORD>") #account details to be filled
```

`python3 nus_htd.py` <br />
`What temperature would you like to declare? 36.9` <br />
`Successfully declared temperature on 22/03/2021 (AM) with 36.9 for user ending 123 .`
